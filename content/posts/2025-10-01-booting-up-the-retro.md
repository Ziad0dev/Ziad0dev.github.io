Welcome to the reboot. This time I'm keeping the stack intentionally tiny:

- Raw HTML templates
- A single `build.js` script
- CSS only (no preprocessors)

> Principle: Every dependency must *pay rent* in clarity or capability.

### Why Not Use a Static Site Generator?

I couldâ€”there are excellent tools. But I want you (and future me) to be able to read every moving part in one sitting. No plugin forests. No hidden cache layer.

### What's Next?

A post on:
1. Pixel-art protection techniques
2. CRT layering without harming accessibility
3. Recreating that "feels alive" vibe with *just enough* animation

Stay tuned.
