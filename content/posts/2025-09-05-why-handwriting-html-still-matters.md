Handwritten HTML slows you down enough to *think*. That friction is productive.

### Benefits

1. **Intentional Structure**: Each element has a semantic reason to exist.
2. **Lower Cognitive Load**: No template indirection layers.
3. **Performance**: Output is lean by default.

### A Practice

Try building a page:
- No build tools
- Single CSS file
- Validate with a screen reader

> Accessibility is easier when you start from semantics instead of re-adding them later.
